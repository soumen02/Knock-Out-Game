# Knock Out
### A 2-player platform shooter

Built from scratch (except for Images and Sounds) on Processing using Python. I decided to make something fun that I would have loved to play as a kid - something with multiple players! The bullets have knockback, and you lose a life when you get knocked off the platforms. 

Implements object oriented programming through classes in every aspect of the game.

## Requirements 
- Processing3.5
  - Python Mode for Processing
  - Minim Library

## Features
- Very smooth character movements and double jump (with friction and acceleration)
- Game Mechanics: Shields, Grenades, Ammo, Gun Variety, Lives ...
- HUD
-  **Directional grenade knockback**
    - Used some trigonometry to simulate different intensities of knockback for different positions around the grenade impact
